   <p style="color: red;">Since 1971, our mission is to promote gardening.
    With over a million members, we are the largest social media website dedicated exclusively to gardening.
    We teach people how to get started gardening and improve their plant growing skills.
    We have online tools that help gardeners connect, teach, share, and trade with each other.
    We help gardeners research information through the continuous development of the world's largest database of plants.
    We conduct gardening market research for the lawn, garden, and nursery industries.
    We help gardening companies reach the public with their products, services and messages.</p>

   <p style="color: red;">
    Our database of plants has been in continuous development since 2010, and now has over 700K plants and nearly half a million photos. Any member of NGA is allowed to contribute to it, and it has had many thousands of different gardeners collaborating in its development. We have a team of administrators and moderators who check each and every addition, helping to ensure accuracy at all times.
Every day new plants and photos are added by our members.
Each plant has all the important data details included, such as sunlight requirements, water needs, etc. For each plant, members can post photos, write comments, and enter in grower performance reports. For cultivars, we track parentage and allow gardeners to easily traverse family trees to see which pollen or pod parent each cultivar was bred from. We also have custom data fields for different kinds of plants. Tomatoes, for example, include data fields for heredity, fruit shape, etc.
Members can keep their own custom lists of plants that they grow (or wish to grow in the future). They can then use this list as a journal where they report milestones in the growth of all their plants. These lists also form the backbone of the world's largest seed swap that occurs each fall, when tens of thousands of seed packets are shared amongst the NGA membership.
We also maintain beautifully designed plant care guides for each of the most popular kinds of plants.
